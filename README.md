Software design document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a company that would like to develop a web-based game “Draw it or Lose it” that operates on multiple platforms. Currently the application is only available on Android.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I think I did well in researching development requirements for each platform that the company wanted their game on (mac, windows, linux, mobile).
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think the model of the entire program really helped me when developing the code. It made it easier to writing the code for the methods needed for each class.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I would go back and revise the recommendations. I think I could have researched more in depth the memory and storage requirements for the game. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpretted the user's needs by using the requirements of the game and thinking what would a single user need in order to run the game. It is imporant to consider the user's needs when designing because those are the people who you are essentially making the game for. You want to make sure the target audience will be able to run and enjoy the program you created. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached designing the software by first understanding what the client wanted in a game application. I then considered the platforms the client wanted the game to be able to run on. Next, I considered the user's needs for the game and made recomendations based on all of these considerations. In the future I hope to gain more knowledge on server requirements in order to provide a more concise and helpful recommendation for these type of applications.
